The commands are
./tsp_sequential <input file>

./tsp_openmp <input file> <thread numbers> [-a]
-a: enable annealing

The format of the input file is a list of the node names followed by
their corresponding x, y coordinates on each new line:

List of node names

=== Annealing ===
temperature at iteration i = temperature / scheduling_fnc
scheduling_fnc generally has asymptotic growth eg log or an s curve

p(accept) = exp( (distance - new_dist) / temp(i) )

It seems like higher starting temperature requires more iterations.
